Some scooters are very small and designed for regular dismantling to fit into the boot of a car. Our canopies are not intended for attachment to these compact types, but if your scooter is sturdy enough you can be sure we have a canopy available for it.Prices may be higher for obscure or very large machines Make & Model Of Your Mobility ScooterYou will need to specify accurately which make & model of scooter you have as each canopy has different attachment brackets and will be tailored to fit you own type precisely using computerised cutting techniques. Some models have slight variations depending on the date of purchase. Others may have been re-badged by the shops that sold them to you . Some may have different titles in different countries. We will help you to work out which type you have even from a picture.Removing Your CanopyCanopies can be quickly removed completely. Easiest done by two assistants, one at the back and one at the front to unclip the webbings, spring the canopy frame from its brackets and lift off into the garage or shed. Important Notes: The canopy is supplied flat packed, to fit the canopy you will need to do some lifting, bending & will also need basic tools & DIY knowledge. The price quoted covers the majority of makes & models however occasionally rare or exceptionally large models may incur extra costs which we will clarify before processing your order. Mobility Scooter canopies are made to order & as such cannot be returned unless faulty or damaged DISCLAIMERWe would always recommend that your canopy is fitted by an engineer or an experienced canopy fitter.
